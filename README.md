# Go compiled to wasm, Binary Search Tree example
 This is a conversion of a project originally written in C++ some years ago, binary search tree re-written in Go & compiled to wasm.
 <br> 
 <br> A working example of this code running can be seen @ http://ianwigley.co.uk/Binary_Search_Tree.html
 <br> The example was compiled with Tiny Go & the output was compressed further with wasm-opt.
